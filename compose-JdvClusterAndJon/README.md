   If everything is properly installed, the following command should be enough

```bash
  sh runDemo.sh
```
   If you have docker-compose installed on your system, you can alternatively start the demo containers with docker-compose:

```bash
  sh runComposer.sh
```

   To stop and destroy demo containers:
```bash
sh destroyDemo.sh
```
  or
```bash
sh destroyComposer.sh
```
